  -- For complex multi-statement imports, consider a single RPC function that does all the work.
  -- However, for this client-side loop, we'll rely on PostgREST's implicit transactions per request.
  -- If one request fails, the client can stop, but atomicity across requests is not guaranteed this way.
  -- A better approach would be a single RPC function that accepts an array of teams/participants.
  -- For now, these functions will be no-ops to satisfy the API code structure.
